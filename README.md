# OrigamiVSC

Like [Origami](https://github.com/SublimeText/Origami) but for VS Code.

**DISCLAIMER**

This is **not** an extension. It is also nowhere near as complex as Origami and is a basic solution that fits my own needs.

This means that I don't guarantee that things will work on your machine as they do on mine.

I also don't take responsibility for any chaos on your machine thanks to this hacky solution. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ

I'm hoping that someone will take notice of this and build a proper extension. üôè

## How to install
1. Install the [macros](https://github.com/geddski/macros) VS Code extension by going [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=geddski.macros).
2. Copy the contents of this [keybindings.json](keybindings.json) to your keybindings.json.
3. Copy the contents of this [settings.json](settings.json) to your settings.json.
4. Done üéâ

# Please Note
1. I have only tested this on macOS.
2. You will only be able to create empty panes if you set the `workbench.editor.closeEmptyGroups` setting to `false`  otherwise the `origamivsc-createPane` command won't work.
3. If the above is set to `false` then you will then have to close panes manually using the `origami-destroyPane` command.

## Features
- [x] Creating Panes
- [x] Destroying the currently selected pane.
- [x] Focusing panes
- [x] Carrying (moving) files to different panes 
- [x] Changing the size of a pane
- [x] Zooming in on a pane
