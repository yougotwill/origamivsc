# OrigamiVSC

Like [Origami](https://github.com/SublimeText/Origami) but for VS Code.

*Note*

This is *not* an extension. It is also nowhere near as complex as Origami and is a basic solution that fits my own needs.

This means that I don't guarantee that things will work on your machine as they do on mine.

I also don't take responsibility for any chaos on your machine thanks to this hacky solution. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ

I'm hoping that someone will take notice of this and build a proper extension. üôè

## How to install
1. Install the [macros](https://github.com/geddski/macros) VS Code extension by clicking [here](vscode:extension/geddski.macros).
2. Copy contents of this [keybindings.json](keybindings.json) to your keybindings.json.
3. Copy contents of this [settings.json](settings.json) to your your settings.json.
4. Done üéâ

## Key shortcuts
Below are the current keybindings for OrigamiVSC.

*Please note* I have only tested this on macOS.

## Special Thanks
Thanks to the creators of both Origami and the macros VS Code extension for making such awesome software.
